- add legend support
- add "subplot" support, such that axes actually line up!
- make layout "smarter"
  - only calculate scale values if min and/or max limits have changed
  - only calculate scale label sizes if they're changed
	- cache the size of title and axis labels, so don't need to get their sizes each time
- add an alternative layout where user specifies plot area margins (between plot boundaries
  and plot_area edges).  Then, positions of axis labels and tic labels are determined based
  on that (and hopefully they fit within the margins).
